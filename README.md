This program allows user to plot satellite's trajectory through near-Earth space and over skyfall of the set observatory based on SGP4 physical model. Program collects satellite data from TLE, which is either being put in directly by user or being found in database by given name of the satellite. Among other features, program allows user to make connection between satellite's position over the observatory skyfall and datetime when satellite can be found in said position. Also, pet the cat.
